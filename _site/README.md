# Machine Unlearning
Exploring techniques to make models forget information

**The field of Machine Unlearning specifically deals with removing the influence of data points from a model without having to retrain it from scratch â€“ in other words, making a model forget certain information. The concept struck my interest as the process of deep learning is very similar to human learning â€“ can model forgetting be related to how the human brain forgets information as well? â€“ ***we all have memories we want to remember, memories we want to forget*** and maybe we can help the model too!**

This project served as an exercise for me to learn about machine *un*learning concepts, read papers on prior research, and figure out the best way to solve the problem at hand using existing methods. While I did intend to produce a new unlearning methodology initially when I undertook this project for class, the ideas presented in the scientific papers that I read have been formulated over years of research in the field, and I felt that it would be infeasible for me to learn and reproduce such an effort for a class project. Therefore, in this project report, I hope to add value to the reader by explaining the approach I took to solve an unlearning problem.
Hope you enjoy the read ðŸ˜Š
